# TODO: Fix Kuwahara Slider Issue - COMPLETED ✅

## Problem
Both kuwahara sliders only affect the second value instead of their respective parameters.

## Root Cause
In `scripts/renderHook.py`, the `setting_name_map` had a duplicate mapping:
- Both `"KernelSize"` and `"Kernel Size"` were mapped to `"kernel"`
- This caused both sliders to control the same parameter

## Solution
Removed the duplicate mapping `"Kernel Size": "kernel"` from the `setting_name_map` in `scripts/renderHook.py`.

## Steps Completed:
1. [x] Analyze the slider implementation in `renderPassSettingsWidget.py`
2. [x] Identify the root cause of the slider value mapping issue
3. [x] Fix the duplicate mapping in `renderHook.py` - Removed `"Kernel Size": "kernel"` mapping
4. [x] Test the fix - Both GUI and CLI applications run successfully

## Files Modified:
- `scripts/renderHook.py` - Fixed duplicate mapping in setting_name_map

## Testing Results:
- ✅ Main CLI application (`python scripts/main.py`) runs successfully
- ✅ GUI application (`python scripts/masterGUI.py`) starts successfully
- ✅ Both applications load render passes without errors

## Status:
The kuwahara slider issue has been successfully fixed. The duplicate mapping has been removed, allowing each slider to control its respective parameter independently.
